  {
    q: "What exactly does TRANSPE do?",
    a: "TRANSPE converts any retail outlet into a full-service financial point. From cash withdrawals and fund transfers to utility bills, prepaid recharges and travel bookings — over 60 services run from a single dashboard. You pocket a commission on each one."
  },
  {
    q: "How is the money protected?",
    a: "Every transaction is routed through authorised partner banks over NPCI-certified rails. Two-factor authentication guards your login, a separate MPIN protects high-value operations, and biometric data is processed only on STQC-approved devices — never stored on our servers."
  },
  {
    q: "What types of bills can I accept?",
    a: "Power, water, piped gas, LPG, broadband, DTH, postpaid mobile, credit card dues, school and college fees, insurance premiums, FASTag top-ups and municipal taxes — over 1,400 billers connected via BBPS and direct integrations."
  },
  {
    q: "What do I need to get started?",
    a: "A valid PAN, Aadhaar and basic shop details. The e-KYC process wraps up in under five minutes — no paperwork to courier, no upfront fee. Many new partners complete their first live transaction the same afternoon."
  },
  {
    q: "How fast do commissions hit my account?",
    a: "The moment a transaction succeeds, your commission is credited to your TRANSPE wallet in real time. You can withdraw to your linked bank account via IMPS around the clock — no monthly settlement cycle."
  },
  {
    q: "Will there be surprise fees later?",
    a: "Absolutely not. The confirmation screen shows every charge and your exact commission before you tap 'Pay'. Commission slabs are published in your dashboard and on our Charges page — no fine print, no escalators."
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of monthly income is realistic?",
    a: "A retailer handling 50 walk-ins a day typically takes home ₹8,000–₹10,000 per month from AePS and money transfers alone. Layer in bills, recharges and POS acceptance and many cross ₹18,000. Slide the calculator above to model your own footfall."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when a transaction fails?",
    a: "If the customer is debited but the service is not delivered, the amount auto-reverses within the mandated reversal window — T+1 for UPI/IMPS, T+5 for AePS. A delay beyond that triggers ₹100/day compensation. You can also raise a dispute from your dashboard and our ops team follows up end to end."
